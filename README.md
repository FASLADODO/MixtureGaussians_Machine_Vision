# MixtureGaussians_Machine_Vision

Using mixture of Gaussians for object recognition.

## Part 1 - Mixture of Gaussians ##

* PracticalMixGaussA - Fitting simple parametric models to visual data. The goal of this part of the project is to fit one Gaussian model to the data for skin and another Gaussian to non-skin pixels, and use this to find the posterior probability that each pixel in an image is skin.
* PracticalMixGaussB - The goal of this practical is to generate some data from a one-dimensional mixtures of Gaussians model, and subsequently to fit a mixtures of Gaussians model to this data, to recover the original parameters.
* PracticalMixGaussC - The goal of this practical is to generate some data from an n-Dimensional mixtures of Gaussians model, and subsequently to fit an n-dimensional mixtures of Gaussians model to it to recover the original parameters.

## Part 2 - Apple Recognition ##

* fitMixGauss - E-M algorithm routine
* models - fitting mixture of gaussians to training data. After empirical experimentation 4 Gaussians were used for apple pixels and 4 Gaussians were used for non-apple pixels.
